  <ol> \
  <li>You need to have <strong>legal permission</strong> to store and process data. \

  Therefore, please fill in this form <a href="https://www.odcf.dkfz.de/files/documents/data_transfer_from_external_sources.docx" target="_blank"><i class="far fa-file-word"></i></a>, \
  have it signed by the PI and send it back to us. If you had your samples sequenced externally and no collaboration partner was involved use this form \

  </li>\
  <li>You can use one of your <strong>existing projects</strong> to store the data. <strong>New projects</strong> need to be set up, if: \
  <ul>\
  <li>the new project will contain different species (mouse, human, ...) than the old one</li>\

readonly.merging=<h4><strong>We found samples that will be merged!</strong></h4> \
  <p>This means that samples in this submission have the same naming scheme \
  (the same PID, SAMPLE_TYPE, SEQUENCING_TYPE, ANTIBODY_TARGET and SINGLE_CELL_WELL_LABEL) as other samples in this submission \
  and/or already existing samples in OTP \
  (the samples referred to in the latter case are additionally displayed below and printed in blue). \
  Withdrawn samples with the same naming scheme may also exist and are also depicted in the table below (WITHDRAWN SAMPLE FROM OTP).</p> \
  <p>Samples with the same naming scheme will be merged during alignment. \
  Even if no alignment will be performed, \
  these samples will be stored together and cannot be kept apart easily on the file system. \
  (The expected resulting path on the filesystem is highlighted.) \
  The withdrawn samples in OTP will not be merged with the samples of the same naming scheme within this submission as they \
  have been set to withdrawn. However, they will be merged once the withdrawn samples may be set to unwithdrawn in the future.</p> \
  <p>Please double check with your bioinformatician and make sure this is something you desire! \
  If you do not wish to have your samples merged, please edit the naming scheme of your samples! \
  Merging during alignment is also subject to sequencing kit, library preparation kit and instrument platform & model.</p> \
  <p>If you wish to use any withdrawn samples for your alignments or downstream analyses and would therefore like to have access \
  to the data of the samples again, please contact us and we will remove the withdrawn status for those samples.<br> \
